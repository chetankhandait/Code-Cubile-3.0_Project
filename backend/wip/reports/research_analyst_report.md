**Investment Potential Ranked List: NVDA vs TSLA**
=====================================================

As a Senior Investment Analyst for Goldman Sachs, I have carefully reviewed the research report on NVDA and TSLA, and I'm pleased to provide my ranked list based on their investment potential.

**Rank 1: NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**
-------------------------------------

NVDA is my top pick due to its strong growth prospects, solid financial performance, and dominant position in the technology industry. The company's focus on artificial intelligence, healthcare, and life sciences is expected to drive significant revenue growth in the future.

Key positives:

* Majority of analysts have a "Buy" rating with a median target price of $350.00, indicating a potential upside of 15% from the current stock price.
* Strong company news, including financial results and new product launches, suggests continued innovation and customer adoption.
* The current stock price of $305.50 is relatively attractive, considering the company's growth potential and industry leadership.

**Rank 2: TSLA (Tesla, Inc.)**
-----------------------------

While TSLA has a strong track record of innovation and customer adoption, I'm more cautious about its investment potential due to its high valuation and mixed analyst recommendations.

Key positives:

* The company's focus on electric vehicles and clean energy is expected to drive long-term growth, and its expanding Supercharger network is a significant competitive advantage.
* Tesla's partnership with SpaceX to develop autonomous electric aircraft presents an exciting opportunity for future revenue growth.

Key concerns:

* The majority of analysts have a "Hold" rating, indicating a more cautious outlook on the company's near-term growth prospects.
* The current stock price of $620.00 is relatively high, making it more challenging to achieve significant returns in the short term.

**Conclusion**

Based on my analysis, I believe NVDA presents a more attractive investment opportunity due to its strong growth prospects, solid financial performance, and relatively attractive stock price. While TSLA has a strong track record of innovation and customer adoption, its high valuation and mixed analyst recommendations make it a more cautious bet.

As always, it's essential to do your own research, consider multiple sources, and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

**Recommendation**

I recommend allocating 60% of the portfolio to NVDA and 40% to TSLA, given their relative investment potential. However, it's crucial to monitor both companies' performance and adjust the portfolio as needed to maximize returns.
